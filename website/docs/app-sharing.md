# App Sharing with CodeX

CodeX v1.1.2 introduces powerful app sharing capabilities that let you share your applications with anyone via secure E2B sandboxes.

## What is App Sharing?

App sharing allows you to:

- **Share your apps publicly** - Show your creations to anyone with a link
- **Collaborate easily** - Share working demos with team members or clients
- **Get feedback** - Let others test your applications in real-time
- **Showcase your work** - Demonstrate your projects to potential employers or clients

## How App Sharing Works

### E2B Sandboxes

- Your app runs in a **secure, isolated environment**
- **Temporary hosting** - Apps are automatically cleaned up after the duration expires
- **Real-time access** - Anyone with the link can access your app immediately
- **No setup required** - Recipients don't need to install anything

### Sharing Process

1. **Build your app** in CodeX
2. **Click the Share button** in the preview panel
3. **Choose duration** (5, 10, or 15 minutes)
4. **Share link is automatically copied** to your clipboard
5. **Send the link** to anyone you want to share with

## Sharing Options

### Duration Settings

Choose how long your shared app stays online:

#### 5 Minutes

- **Best for**: Quick demos, testing
- **Use case**: Showing a feature to a colleague
- **Cost**: Free

#### 10 Minutes

- **Best for**: Short presentations
- **Use case**: Client demos, brief showcases

## How to Share Your App

### Step 1: Build Your App

2. Make sure it's working correctly in the preview
3. Test all the features you want to share

### Step 2: Open Share Panel

1. Look for the **Share** button in the preview panel
2. Click to open the sharing interface
3. You'll see the share panel with duration options

### Step 3: Configure Sharing

1. **Select duration** from the dropdown (5, 10, or 15 minutes)
2. **Click "Share App"** to start the sharing process
3. **Wait for confirmation** - The app will be uploaded to E2B

### Step 4: Share the Link

2. **Send to recipients** via email, chat, or any messaging platform
3. **Recipients can access immediately** - No installation required

## Monitoring Your Shared Apps

### Real-Time Status

- **Live status updates** - See when your app is ready
- **Progress indicators** - Visual feedback during upload
- **Error handling** - Clear messages if something goes wrong

### Status Types

- **Starting** - Sandbox is being created
- **Running** - App is live and accessible
- **Stopping** - Sandbox is shutting down
- **Expired** - Sharing duration has ended

### Logs and Debugging

- **View logs** - See what's happening behind the scenes
- **Debug issues** - Identify problems with your app
- **Monitor performance** - Track how your app is running

## Best Practices

### Before Sharing

1. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure your app works correctly
2. **Check all features** - Verify everything you want to show works
3. **Prepare your demo** - Know what you want to highlight
4. **Choose appropriate duration** - Don't share longer than needed

### During Sharing

1. **Monitor status** - Keep an eye on the share panel
2. **Be ready to help** - Recipients might have questions
3. **Have backup plans** - In case the shared app has issues

### After Sharing

1. **Gather feedback** - Ask recipients for their thoughts
2. **Note any issues** - Use feedback to improve your app
3. **Clean up** - Apps automatically expire, but monitor usage

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Share

- **Check internet connection** - Ensure stable connectivity
- **Verify app is working** - Test in preview before sharing
- **Try different duration** - Some apps might need more time to start

### Recipients Can't Access

- **Check the link** - Make sure it was copied correctly
- **Verify duration** - Ensure the sharing period hasn't expired
- **Test the link yourself** - Open it in a different browser

### App Runs Slowly

- **Check app complexity** - Simple apps share faster
- **Monitor resources** - E2B sandboxes have resource limits
- **Optimize your app** - Remove unnecessary dependencies

### Sharing Fails

- **Check E2B status** - Service might be temporarily unavailable
- **Try again** - Sometimes retrying works
- **Contact support** - If issues persist

## Security and Privacy

### Secure Environment

- **Isolated sandboxes** - Your app runs in a secure container
- **Automatic cleanup** - Apps are deleted after expiration
- **No persistent storage** - Data doesn't persist between sessions

### What's Shared

- **Only your app** - No access to your local files
- **Public access** - Anyone with the link can view
- **Temporary hosting** - Apps are automatically removed

### Privacy Considerations

- **Don't share sensitive data** - Only share what you want public
- **Use appropriate duration** - Don't share longer than necessary
- **Monitor access** - Be aware of who has the link

## Use Cases

### Development

- **Show progress** - Share work-in-progress with team members
- **Get feedback** - Let others test your features
- **Debug together** - Collaborate on fixing issues

### Client Work

- **Present demos** - Show clients your progress
- **Gather requirements** - Let clients interact with prototypes
- **Get approval** - Demonstrate completed features

### Learning

- **Share projects** - Show your learning projects to others
