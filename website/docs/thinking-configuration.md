# Thinking Configuration in CodeX

CodeX v1.2.0 introduces **universal thinking support** - all AI models now support advanced reasoning and thinking capabilities. This guide explains how to configure and optimize thinking for the best results.

## What is AI Thinking?

### Understanding Thinking

AI thinking is a process where models:

- **Reason through problems** step-by-step before responding
- **Consider multiple approaches** to find the best solution
- **Analyze context** more thoroughly for better understanding
- **Plan their responses** for more accurate and helpful answers

### Benefits of Thinking

- **Better problem-solving** - More accurate and thoughtful responses
- **Complex reasoning** - Models can work through multi-step problems
- **Improved code quality** - Better understanding of requirements and edge cases
- **Reduced errors** - More careful analysis leads to fewer mistakes

- "Debug this React component"
- "Refactor this code for better performance"
- "Design a database schema"

### High (Dynamic)

**Best for**: Complex problems requiring deep analysis

**Characteristics**:

- **Speed**: Slower but most thorough
- **Cost**: Highest token usage
- **Thinking**: Extensive reasoning and analysis
- **Use cases**:
  - Complex algorithms
  - System architecture
  - Research projects
  - Multi-step problem solving

**Example scenarios**:

- "Design a scalable microservices architecture"
- "Implement a complex machine learning algorithm"
- "Research and compare different database solutions"
- "Plan a large-scale application migration"

## How to Configure Thinking

### Step 1: Access Settings

1. Open CodeX
2. Go to **Settings** → **Thinking Budget**
3. You'll see the thinking budget selector

### Step 2: Choose Your Setting

Select from three options:

- **Low** - Minimal thinking for faster responses
- **Medium** - Balanced thinking (recommended default)
- **High** - Extended thinking for complex problems

### Step 3: Apply to All Models

- The setting applies to **all AI models** automatically
- No need to configure each model separately
- Change the setting anytime based on your current task

## Optimizing Thinking for Different Tasks

### Development Tasks

#### Quick Fixes and Simple Changes

- **Setting**: Low
- **Why**: Fast response for straightforward tasks
- **Examples**: Syntax errors, simple styling, basic functionality

#### Feature Development

- **Setting**: Medium
- **Why**: Balanced thinking for most development work
- **Examples**: New components, API integration, user interfaces

#### Complex Features

- **Setting**: High
- **Why**: Thorough analysis for complex implementations
- **Examples**: Authentication systems, data processing, integrations

### Debugging

#### Simple Bugs

- **Setting**: Low
- **Why**: Quick identification of obvious issues
- **Examples**: Typos, missing imports, simple logic errors

#### Complex Bugs

- **Setting**: Medium to High
- **Why**: Deep analysis to find root causes
- **Examples**: Performance issues, race conditions, complex logic errors

### Architecture and Planning

#### Small Projects

- **Setting**: Medium
- **Why**: Sufficient planning for smaller applications
- **Examples**: Single-page apps, simple websites, basic tools

#### Large Projects

- **Setting**: High
- **Why**: Comprehensive planning and analysis
- **Examples**: Enterprise applications, complex systems, multi-service architectures

## Tips for Better Thinking Results

### 1. Match Setting to Task Complexity

- **Simple tasks** → Low thinking
- **Regular development** → Medium thinking
- **Complex problems** → High thinking

### 2. Provide Clear Context

- **Describe your project** clearly
- **Mention specific technologies** or frameworks
- **Provide relevant examples** when possible
- **Explain your goals** and constraints

### 3. Use Progressive Thinking

- Start with **Medium** for most tasks
- Increase to **High** for complex problems
- Decrease to **Low** for simple fixes

### 4. Monitor Results

- **Observe response quality** with different settings
- **Adjust based on results** - if responses are too brief, increase thinking
- **Balance speed vs. quality** based on your needs

## Understanding Thinking Output

### What You'll See

When models use thinking, you'll see:

- **Thinking blocks** in the response (collapsible by default)
- **Step-by-step reasoning** before the final answer
- **More detailed explanations** of the approach taken
- **Better structured responses** with clear reasoning

### Thinking vs. Final Response

- **Thinking content**: Internal reasoning process (collapsible)
- **Final response**: The actual answer or code (always visible)
- **Both are valuable**: Thinking shows the process, response shows the result

## Troubleshooting Thinking Issues

### Responses Too Brief

- **Increase thinking budget** to Medium or High
- **Provide more context** in your request
- **Try a more capable model** for complex tasks

### Responses Too Slow

- **Decrease thinking budget** to Low
- **Use a faster model** like Haiku or Flash
- **Break complex requests** into smaller parts

### Poor Quality Responses

- **Increase thinking budget** to High
- **Try a more capable model** like Claude 4 or GPT-5
- **Provide better context** and examples

### Thinking Not Working

- **Check your model selection** - all models support thinking
- **Verify thinking budget setting** is not set to "Off"
- **Try a different model** to test thinking capabilities

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Medium

- Use **Medium** as your default setting
- Adjust up or down based on task complexity
- Most development work benefits from Medium thinking

### 2. Be Specific

- **Describe your exact needs** clearly
- **Provide context** about your project
- **Mention constraints** or requirements
- **Give examples** when helpful

### 3. Iterate and Refine

- **Start with a basic request** and Medium thinking
- **Refine based on results** - adjust thinking level if needed
- **Use follow-up questions** to improve responses

### 4. Monitor Performance

- **Track response quality** with different settings
- **Balance speed vs. thoroughness** based on your workflow
- **Adjust settings** based on the type of work you're doing
