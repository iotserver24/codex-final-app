# AI Models in CodeX

CodeX v1.1.2 supports 50+ AI models from multiple providers, with **universal thinking capabilities** now available for all models.

## Universal Thinking Support

### What is Thinking?

Thinking allows AI models to reason through problems step-by-step before providing their final response. This leads to:

- **Better problem-solving** - More accurate and thoughtful responses
- **Complex reasoning** - Models can work through multi-step problems
- **Improved code quality** - Better understanding of requirements and edge cases

- **Budget-conscious**: Use free models or smaller paid models

### 2. Adjust Thinking Intensity

- **Quick fixes**: Use Low thinking budget
- **Feature development**: Use Medium thinking budget
- **Architecture decisions**: Use High thinking budget

### 3. Provide Clear Context

- Describe your project clearly
- Mention specific technologies or frameworks
- Provide examples when possible

### 4. Iterate and Refine

- Start with a basic request
- Refine based on the model's response
- Use follow-up questions to improve results

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Responding

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid
- Try switching to a different model

### Poor Response Quality

- Increase thinking budget to High
- Try a more capable model
- Provide more detailed context

### Slow Responses

- Decrease thinking budget to Low
- Use a faster model like Haiku or Flash
- Check your internet connection
