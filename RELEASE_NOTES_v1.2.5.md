Date: 2025-10-02

## üöÄ What's New

- Switched update source to `http://api.xibe.app/api/releases/latest` with platform-aware assets.
- Update dialogs now render rich Markdown (GFM) with safe inline media (images, audio, video).
- Single, system-detected download button in the update modal for a simpler UX.
- Wider update modal and taller changelog viewport for better readability.
- New Donate popup with three options:
  - Razorpay (India): `https://razorpay.me/@megavault`
  - Buy Me a Coffee: `https://buymeacoffee.com/r3ap3redit`
  - Polar: `https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_NR3IF9VYKBFO5QHq4Vi8fLGLGpC3Mb6h3EU5r3Crspl`
- Smarter Model Picker: clearer model groups (cloud and local), cleaner names, and fast access to the models you actually use.
- Safer Send Flow: the Send button now stays disabled when an approval is required, preventing accidental submits.
- Simpler Provider Setup: clearer status for provider configuration and a more direct path to being ‚Äúready to use.‚Äù
